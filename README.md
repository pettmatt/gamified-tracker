# Gamified Tracker

The application was scrapped in 2023 and converted to Vue in 2024. The application was meant to be cardio exercise application that can visualize the progress of a person. Because of personal use case I chose to scrap the app idea. Btw. Best experience is achieved by using Firefox. Chrome works, but it has some visual issues.
